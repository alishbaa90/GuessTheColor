# Guess the Color Game

A fun and interactive game where players are presented with an RGB color code, and they have to guess the correct color from six color boxes. You have only 10 moves to find the correct color. 

## How to Play

1. The game starts with a randomly generated RGB color code (e.g., `rgb(255, 0, 0)`).
2. Six color boxes are displayed below the RGB code. Only one box matches the RGB code given.
3. Click on a color box to make your guess.
4. You have a maximum of 10 moves to guess the correct color.
5. If you guess correctly within 10 moves, you win the game! If not, the game ends, and you can start again.
